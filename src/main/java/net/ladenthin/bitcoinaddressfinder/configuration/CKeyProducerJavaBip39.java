    * to mark hardened keys. Hardened derivation prevents the possibility of deriving child public keys 
    * from a parent public key alone.
    * 
    * With hardened keys:
    * - It is impossible to derive child public keys using only the parent public key.
    * - This enhances security by preventing attacks where knowledge of a parent public key and a 
    *   child private key could allow recovery of the parent private key.
    * 
    * With non-hardened keys:
    * - You can derive child public keys from a parent public key without needing any private key.
    * - However, this introduces a potential vulnerability: if a child private key and the parent public key 
    *   are both compromised, the parent private key can be exposed due to elliptic curve mathematics.
    * 
    * Setting this flag to true enables hardened key derivation; false means non-hardened.
