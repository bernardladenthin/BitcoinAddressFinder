## About BitcoinAddressFinder
**BitcoinAddressFinder** is a free, high-performance tool designed to rapidly scan random private keys for a wide range of cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Zcash, and many more.

Its primary goal is to generate addresses (compressed and uncompressed) as efficiently as possible by combining the power of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with OpenCL for hardware acceleration.

Once generated, each address is checked against a high-performance database (**LMDB**) to determine whether it has ever been used — effectively identifying addresses that might hold a balance. This includes detecting potential RIPEMD160 hash collisions and exploring known or partially known keyspaces.

Whether you're searching for vanity addresses, verifying address usage, or experimenting with cryptographic edge cases, BitcoinAddressFinder is built for speed, flexibility, and offline use.

**Made with ❤️ in Germany**

## Requirements
- **Java 21 or newer** is required to run BitcoinAddressFinder.  
  Older versions such as Java 8, 11, or 17 are not supported.

- **🚀 OpenCL (optional)**:  
  You can run this software in either **CPU-only** mode or with **GPU acceleration via OpenCL** for significantly enhanced performance.

  When OpenCL is enabled:
  - **Elliptic Curve Key Generation** is offloaded to one or more OpenCL-capable devices (e.g., GPUs), dramatically boosting key scanning throughput.
  - **SHA-256** and **RIPEMD-160** hashing operations are also offloaded to the GPU, further reducing CPU load and increasing overall efficiency.
  - **Multi-GPU setups are fully supported** — each device can be configured individually, enabling efficient parallelization and scalability across multiple GPUs.

## Quickstart
1. Download the binary (jar) from https://github.com/bernardladenthin/BitcoinAddressFinder/releases
2. Download and extract the light database from https://github.com/bernardladenthin/BitcoinAddressFinder#use-my-prepared-database
3. Download a configuration set like:
- [`logbackConfiguration.xml`](https://github.com/bernardladenthin/BitcoinAddressFinder/blob/main/examples/logbackConfiguration.xml)
- [`config_Find_1OpenCLDevice.json`](https://github.com/bernardladenthin/BitcoinAddressFinder/blob/main/examples/config_Find_1OpenCLDevice.json)
- [`run_Find_1OpenCLDevice.bat`](https://github.com/bernardladenthin/BitcoinAddressFinder/blob/main/examples/run_Find_1OpenCLDevice.bat)
4. Put all in one directory like the following structure
  * Downloads
    * lmdb
      * data.mdb
      * lock.mdb
    * bitcoinaddressfinder-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    * logbackConfiguration.xml
    * config_Find_1OpenCLDevice.js
    * run_Find_1OpenCLDevice.bat
5. Run the file run_Find_1OpenCLDevice.bat

## Features
* Supports blockchain addresses based on [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1).
* Unit-tested, trusted open source that can be compiled easily by yourself.
* Vanity generation of Bitcoin addresses using regex patterns.
* Runs completely offline — no internet required or used. You can run it in a bunker with a generator in the middle of nowhere, and no one will know.
* No synchronization required to run multiple instances. Random numbers are used, so no coordinated search strategy is needed — just run it on multiple machines.
* Checks a high-performance database of known addresses to detect already used ones.
* Portable, platform-independent, runs on the JVM.
* Generates both uncompressed and compressed keys simultaneously.
* EC key generation via:
  * Multiple CPU threads
  * Multiple OpenCL devices (optional)

### ⚡ ECC Scalar Multiplication Optimizations
To accelerate `k·G` (private key × base point), the OpenCL kernel uses:

- **Windowed Non-Adjacent Form (wNAF)**:
  The scalar `k` is converted to a signed digit representation using a **window size of 4**.  
  This results in digits from the set `{±1, ±3, ±5, ±7}`, with at least one zero between non-zero digits.  
  This reduces the number of costly additions during multiplication.
  [Further explanation of wNAF on crypto.stackexchange.com](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/82013/simple-explanation-of-sliding-window-and-wnaf-methods-of-elliptic-curve-point-mu)

- **Precomputed Table**:
  The kernel precomputes and stores the following multiples of the base point `G`:
  - `±1·G`, `±3·G`, `±5·G`, `±7·G`  
  These are stored in the `secp256k1_t` structure and used during scalar multiplication.

- **Left-to-Right Scalar Multiplication**:
  The multiplication loop scans the wNAF digits from most to least significant:
  - Each iteration **always doubles** the current point.
  - If the current digit is non-zero, it **adds the matching precomputed point**.

- **Optimized for GPGPU (not constant-time)**:
  To prioritize speed on OpenCL/CUDA devices, this implementation is **not constant-time** and may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks in adversarial environments.

- **Use of Constant Memory**:
  Precomputed points are stored in **constant GPU memory** (`__constant` via `CONSTANT_AS`), allowing fast access by all threads in a workgroup.

### 🔄 Scalar Walker per Kernel (loopCount implemented)
The OpenCL kernel now supports a **loop-based scalar walker** using the `loopCount` parameter. Each GPU thread performs multiple key derivations by:

- Computing the first point using **full scalar multiplication** via `point_mul_xy`
- Then repeating efficient **affine point additions** via `point_add_xy` to derive subsequent keys:
  **Pₙ₊₁ = Pₙ + G**

This enables linear traversal of keyspace per thread:
`k₀·G, (k₀ + 1)·G, (k₀ + 2)·G, ..., (k₀ + loopCount - 1)·G`

It reduces kernel launch overhead and improves GPU utilization, especially in memory- or dispatch-bound scenarios.

Example:
- If `loopCount = 8`, a single thread computes 8 keys internally
- Grid size is reduced by a factor of 8
- Output is written to global memory per key

> ✅ Lower `loopCount` values like 4 or 8 are often ideal.  
> ❌ Too high values may reduce GPU occupancy due to fewer launched work-items.

### 🚀 In-Memory Address Cache (loadToMemoryCacheOnInit)
To improve address lookup performance during high-speed key generation, you can enable the `loadToMemoryCacheOnInit` option.  
This feature loads all LMDB entries into a Java `HashSet` at startup, allowing ultra-fast `O(1)` address checks.

This is especially useful in OpenCL or batch scenarios where thousands or millions of addresses are checked per second and LMDB access becomes a bottleneck.

> ✅ Recommended when system RAM is sufficient to hold all known addresses  
> ❌ Avoid on memory-constrained systems or with extremely large databases

### 🔐 Public Key Hashing on GPU (SHA-256 + RIPEMD-160)
The OpenCL kernel now performs **blazing fast public key hashing** directly on the GPU using:

- `SHA-256(x || y)` followed by
- `RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(x || y))`

This allows each GPU thread to independently generate full Bitcoin-style public key hashes (i.e., `hash160`) **without CPU involvement**.

Benefits:
- No host-side post-processing needed
- Fully parallelized and memory-efficient
- Ideal for massive batch generation and filtering

> ✅ Output is already in hash160 format, ready for address comparison

### 🚀 MSB-Zero Scalar Walk Strategy
To boost performance, BitcoinAddressFinder uses a **160-bit scalar optimization**:

- The **96 most significant bits** of each private key are set to zero.
- Only the **lower 160 bits** vary — matching the output size of `RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey))`.

This shortens the ECC scalar and accelerates point multiplication.

Combined with the `loopCount` walker:
- The first point is computed via `point_mul_xy`
- All subsequent keys use `point_add_xy` inside the kernel:
  **Pₙ₊₁ = Pₙ + G**

This enables high-throughput, grid-parallel **linear keyspace traversal** like:
`k₀·G, (k₀+1)·G, (k₀+2)·G, ...`

> ✅ Massive speedup for brute-force or batch-based searches using OpenCL

## Address Database
The addresses are stored in a high-performance database: [LMDB](https://github.com/LMDB).
The database can be used to check whether a generated address has ever been used.

### Import
The importer reads multiple `.txt` or `.text` files containing addresses in arbitrary order. Each line can contain a different format.
* Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH)
* Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)
* Pay-to-Multisig (P2MS)
* SegWit - Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH)
* Pay-to-Witness-Script-Key-Hash (P2WSH)
* Payt-to-TapRoot (P2TR)

### Create the database by yourself
Useful txt/text file provider:
* http://blockdata.loyce.club/alladdresses/
* https://blockchair.com/dumps


### Export
The exporter provides various output formats for Bitcoin and altcoin address data:

* **HexHash**  
  Exports addresses as raw `hash160` (RIPEMD-160 of the SHA-256 of the public key), encoded in hexadecimal. No version byte or checksum is included. Ideal for advanced usage and low-level comparison. Best viewed in fixed-width hex viewers (e.g., HxD).

* **FixedWidthBase58BitcoinAddress**  
  Exports Base58Check-encoded addresses (e.g., legacy `P2PKH`) in a fixed-width format for consistent alignment. No amount is included. Suitable for hex/byte-aligned visual inspection and batch comparison.

* **DynamicWidthBase58BitcoinAddressWithAmount**  
  Exports Base58Check-encoded addresses along with their associated amounts (e.g., balance or UTXO value), using a dynamic-width format. Suitable for human-readable CSV-like formats and analytics.

### Use My Prepared Database
I am in the process of building and publishing databases containing large sets of Bitcoin and altcoin addresses.  
(Refer to the **Import** section above for details on supported address formats.)

> The sources of these addresses are confidential, but you are fully permitted to extract, inspect, and use them.

You are also welcome to **extend this database** by importing your own address data. This allows you to build upon the existing dataset, tailoring it to your specific needs (e.g., adding additional coins, formats, or private address collections).

If you're missing any information or have questions about usage or content, feel free to ask or open an issue.

#### Light database
* Light (5.23 GiB), Last update: June 1, 2025
  * Contains Bitcoin addresses whith amount and many altcoin addresses with amount.
  * Static amount of 0 is used to allow best compression.
  * Unique entries: 127367117
  * Mapsize: 5368 MiB
  * Time to create the database: ~9 hours
  * Link (3.53 GiB zip archive): http://ladenthin.net/lmdb_light.zip
  * Link extracted addresses as txt (4.98 GiB) (2.20 GiB zip archive); open with HxD, set 42 bytes each line: http://ladenthin.net/LMDBToAddressFile_Light_HexHash.zip

> 💡 **Hint:** When using the light database, it is **strongly recommended** to enable the following setting in your configuration:
> ```json
> "loadToMemoryCacheOnInit" : true
> ```  
> Although LMDB is very fast, a Java `HashSet` provides true **O(1)** lookups compared to **O(log n)** (or worse) with disk-backed access.
> Enabling this flag loads all addresses into memory at startup, resulting in significantly higher throughput during key scanning — especially for OpenCL or high-frequency batch operations.

## Find Addresses
> ⚠️ **Security Warning**: This software is intended for research and educational purposes. Do **not** use it in production or on systems connected to the internet.

A secure environment should be fully isolated — ideally an air-gapped computer (physically disconnected from all networks).  
The software is highly optimized for performance and **not designed to run in constant time**, which means it may be vulnerable to **side-channel attacks** on shared or exposed systems.

For generated vanity addresses or private keys, consider storing them safely using a [paper wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet).

### Mixed Modes
You can combine **vanity address generation** with **database lookups** to enhance functionality and efficiency.

For example:
- Search for personalized (vanity) addresses using custom patterns **and**
- Simultaneously check if the generated addresses already **exist in the LMDB** database

This hybrid mode allows you to find rare or meaningful addresses while ensuring they haven’t been used before.

### Key Range

You can define a custom key range for private key generation—for example, limiting the search space to 64-bit keys.  
In this setup, the first 192 bits (256-bit - 64-bit) of the key are zeroed, effectively restricting the generation to a specific portion of the keyspace.

This feature can be used for:

- **Targeted key recovery**, such as searching for private keys from known ranges like the [Bitcoin Puzzle Transaction](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx)
- **Verification and testing**, to prove that the software functions correctly within a predictable key range

### OpenCL Acceleration

To significantly boost the performance of EC key generation, the software supports OpenCL-based parallelization.

A shared secret (base key) is transferred to the OpenCL device along with a predefined grid size. Each OpenCL thread independently derives a unique EC key by incrementing the base key with its thread ID. This allows the generation of a batch of EC keys in a single execution cycle. Once generated, the keys are transferred back to the host (CPU) memory for further processing.

The CPU then hashes the X and Y coordinates of the public keys to derive the corresponding (Bitcoin/Altcoin) addresses. This division of labor offloads the computationally expensive elliptic curve operations to the GPU, allowing the CPU to focus on faster address hashing and database lookup operations—resulting in improved overall throughput.

#### Built-in Self-Test (BIST)

The OpenCL backend includes a built-in self-test mechanism that cross-verifies results from the GPU against a CPU-generated reference. This ensures that the OpenCL device is functioning correctly and producing valid EC keys—giving end users confidence in the reliability of their hardware-accelerated address search.
> 💡 **Hint:** To enable the built-in self-test, make sure the following configuration flag is set to `true`:  
> ```json
> "runtimePublicKeyCalculationCheck": true
> ```  
> This option is disabled by default. Enabling it is especially useful during development, debugging, or when validating new hardware setups.

#### Performance Benchmarks

> **Note:** OpenCL generates uncompressed keys. Compressed keys can be derived from uncompressed ones with minimal overhead.

## Collision Probability and Security Considerations

> Isn't it impossible to find collisions?

The likelihood of discovering a collision—two different inputs that produce the same output hash—is **astronomically low** when using secure cryptographic functions like **SHA-256** and **RIPEMD-160**, which are employed in Bitcoin address generation.

However, discussions around potential vulnerabilities, theoretical attacks, or edge cases exist in the cryptography and Bitcoin communities.

For more in-depth information on collision resistance, address reuse risks, and cryptographic hash functions, refer to the following resources:

## Known Issues

### Hybrid Graphics Performance (Low Throughput)

Laptops with hybrid graphics—using both integrated (iGPU) and discrete (dGPU) GPUs—may suffer from significantly reduced performance when running compute-intensive OpenCL workloads like BitcoinAddressFinder. This is often due to:

- Shared memory between CPU and GPU
- Bandwidth limitations
- Automatic GPU switching (e.g., NVIDIA Optimus, AMD Enduro)
- Suboptimal GPU selection by drivers

| **MSI**            | Gaming laptops with switchable graphics          | Use **Dragon Center** to select dGPU     |
| **Razer**          | Blade models with NVIDIA Optimus                 | Use **Razer Synapse** to enforce dGPU use |
| **Apple (Intel)**  | MacBook Pro (pre-2021 with dual GPUs)            | macOS → Disable *Automatic Graphics Switching* in Energy Preferences |

> If your laptop uses hybrid graphics, always ensure that the **discrete GPU** is explicitly selected for OpenCL workloads to avoid severe performance bottlenecks.

## Future improvements
- Refactor the entire key generation infrastructure to support a key provider. This provider should be configurable to supply private keys from various sources, such as Random, Secrets File, Key Range, and others. All consumers should retrieve keys from this provider.

### KeyProvider
- Key generation within a specific key range. See #27
Wished from themaster:
```
"privateKeyStartHex" : "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000037e26d5b1f3afe216"
"privateKeyEndHex" : "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000037e26d5b1ffffffff"
```
Wished from Ulugbek:
```
// Search started from given address. Would be nice if it can save last position...
"sequentalSearch" : true,
"startAddress" : xxxxxxxx,

// Random search with batches, here 100000. I,e. some random number is found and after 100000 sequental addresses should be checked.
"searchAsBatches" : true,
"searchBatchQuantity" : 100000,


// Random search within Address Space, with batches, here 100000.
"searchAsBatches" : true,
"searchAddressStart" : xxxxxxx,
"searchAddressEnd" : xxxxxxxy,
"searchBatchQuantity" : 100000
```

- Incomplete Seed-Phrase as Private KeyProvider. Wished from @mirasu See #38
- Socket KeyProvider for independend KeyProvider via byte protocol
  - Ideas might be a screen recorder and use the visible screen downscaled as 256 bit input
- KeyProvider must get the grid size to increment properly on incremental based Producer
- ExecutableKeyProvider gets data from stdout
