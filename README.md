## About BitcoinAddressFinder
**BitcoinAddressFinder** is a free, high-performance tool for scanning random private keys across a wide range of cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Zcash, and many more.

Its core purpose is to generate both **compressed** and **uncompressed** addresses with maximum efficiency, combining the portability of the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** with **OpenCL-powered GPU acceleration**.

Each generated address is checked against a high-speed **LMDB** database to detect whether it has ever been used — identifying possible balances, known keyspaces, and even **RIPEMD160 hash collisions**.

🔍 Whether you're generating vanity addresses, verifying address usage, or experimenting with cryptographic edge cases, **BitcoinAddressFinder** is built for **speed**, **flexibility**, and **fully offline operation**.

> 🔐 Runs air-gapped · ⚡ GPU-accelerated · 🧪 Unit-tested · 🛠️ Extensible

**Made with ❤️ in Germany**

## Requirements
- **Java 21 or newer** is required to run BitcoinAddressFinder.  
  Older versions such as Java 8, 11, or 17 are not supported.

- **🚀 OpenCL (optional)**:  
  You can run this software in either **CPU-only** mode or with **GPU acceleration via OpenCL** for significantly enhanced performance.

  When OpenCL is enabled:
  - **Elliptic Curve Key Generation** is offloaded to one or more OpenCL-capable devices (e.g., GPUs), dramatically boosting key scanning throughput.
  - **SHA-256** and **RIPEMD-160** hashing operations are also offloaded to the GPU, further reducing CPU load and increasing overall efficiency.
  - **Multi-GPU setups are fully supported** — each device can be configured individually, enabling efficient parallelization and scalability across multiple GPUs.

## Quickstart

### ⚡ ECC Scalar Multiplication Optimizations
To accelerate **elliptic curve scalar multiplication** (`k·G`, i.e. private key × base point), the OpenCL kernel applies the following optimizations:

- **Windowed Non-Adjacent Form (wNAF)**:  
  The scalar `k` is converted to a signed digit representation using a **window size of 4**.  
  This results in digits from the set `{±1, ±3, ±5, ±7}`, with at least one zero between non-zero digits.  
  This reduces the number of costly additions during multiplication.  
  [Further explanation of wNAF on crypto.stackexchange.com](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/82013/simple-explanation-of-sliding-window-and-wnaf-methods-of-elliptic-curve-point-mu)

- **Precomputed Table**:  
  The kernel precomputes and stores the following multiples of the base point `G`:  
  `±1·G`, `±3·G`, `±5·G`, `±7·G`  
  These are stored in the `secp256k1_t` structure and reused during scalar multiplication.

- **Left-to-Right Scalar Multiplication**:  
  The multiplication loop scans the wNAF digits from most to least significant:  
  - Each iteration **always doubles** the current point.  
  - If the current digit is non-zero, it **adds the matching precomputed point**.

- **Optimized for GPGPU (not constant-time)**:  
  To prioritize speed on OpenCL/CUDA devices, this implementation is **not constant-time** and may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks in adversarial environments.

- **Use of Constant Memory**:  
  Precomputed points are stored in **constant GPU memory** (`__constant` via `CONSTANT_AS`), allowing fast access by all threads in a workgroup.

### 🔄 Scalar Walker per Kernel (`loopCount`)
The OpenCL kernel supports a **loop-based scalar strategy** controlled by the `loopCount` parameter. Each GPU thread generates multiple EC keys by:

- Computing the first key via full scalar multiplication: `P₀ = k₀·G` (using `point_mul_xy`)  
- Computing subsequent keys via efficient affine additions: `Pₙ₊₁ = Pₙ + G` (using `point_add_xy`)

This enables high-throughput, grid-parallel **linear keyspace traversal** like:  
`k₀·G, (k₀ + 1)·G, ..., (k₀ + loopCount - 1)·G`

Example:  
- If `loopCount = 8`, each thread generates 8 keys  
- Grid size is reduced by a factor of 8  
- All results are written to global memory

> ✅ Lower `loopCount` values like 4 or 8 are often ideal.  
> ❌ Higher values may reduce GPU occupancy due to fewer active threads.

### 🚀 MSB-Zero Optimization
To accelerate elliptic curve multiplication, BitcoinAddressFinder applies a **160-bit private key optimization**:

- The upper 96 bits of each 256-bit private key are set to zero  
- Only the lower 160 bits are randomized and traversed

This reduction in scalar size speeds up `k·G` computations, resulting in significantly better performance during brute-force and batch-based key scanning.

> ✅ Matches the size of `RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey))`  
> ✅ Especially effective when combined with OpenCL acceleration

### 🚀 Bloom Filter Address Cache (`useBloomFilter`)
As of version 1.5.0, a memory-efficient Bloom filter can be used to significantly accelerate address checks:

```json
"useBloomFilter": true
```

Instead of loading all addresses into a Java `HashSet`, a compact Bloom filter is loaded into RAM. This enables ultra-fast `containsAddress()` checks with minimal memory usage — even for millions or billions of entries.
Advantages:
- ✅ O(1) lookup speed (comparable to HashSet)
- ✅ Low memory usage, even with large datasets
- ✅ No false negatives (real matches are always detected)
- ⚠️ Possible false positives → only trigger additional LMDB lookups

#### Estimated Memory Usage:
| fpp    | Light Database (~132M) | Full Database (~1.37B)  |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 0.1    | ~**80 MB**             | ~**800 MB**             |
| 0.05   | ~**100 MB**            | ~**1024 MB**            |
| 0.01   | ~**151 MB**            | ~**1574 MB**            |

#### 🔧 Tuning Accuracy with `bloomFilterFpp`
The expected false positive probability (FPP) can be configured:

```json
"bloomFilterFpp": 0.1
```

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `0.01` | ✅ Only ~1% false positives – high accuracy, more memory |
| `0.05` | ⚖️ Balanced tradeoff between memory and performance |
| `0.1`–`0.2` | 🪶 Very memory-efficient – suitable if some false positives are acceptable |

```json
"useBloomFilter": true,
"bloomFilterFpp": 0.1
```
Recommended setting for best balance between speed and memory usage.

### 🔐 Public Key Hashing on GPU (SHA-256 + RIPEMD-160)
The OpenCL kernel performs **blazing fast public key hashing** directly on the GPU using:

- `SHA-256(pubkey.x || pubkey.y)` followed by  
- `RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(pubkey))`

This allows each GPU thread to independently generate full Bitcoin-style public key hashes (`hash160`) **without CPU involvement**.

Benefits:  
- No host-side post-processing needed  
- Fully parallelized and memory-efficient  
- Ideal for massive batch generation and filtering

> ✅ Output is already in hash160 format, ready for address comparison

## Address Database
The addresses are stored in a high-performance database: [LMDB](https://github.com/LMDB).
The database can be used to check whether a generated address has ever been used.

### Address Import Support

The importer supports reading multiple `.txt` or `.text` files, each containing one address per line in arbitrary order. Lines may vary in address type and format. Each line may also optionally include an associated coin amount.

⚠️ **Unsupported or malformed lines are silently skipped during import.**

#### Supported Address Types

* **P2PKH** – Pay to Public Key Hash
  Encoded using Base58. Most commonly used format for legacy Bitcoin addresses.

* **P2SH** – Pay to Script Hash
  Base58-encoded address type used for multisig and other script-based spending conditions.

* **P2MS** – Pay to Multisig
  Custom format prefixed with `d-`, `m-`, or `s-` (e.g. `m-<script>`).

* **P2WPKH** – Pay to Witness Public Key Hash
  Native SegWit v0 address, encoded in **Bech32**.

* **P2WSH** – Pay to Witness Script Hash
  Native SegWit v0 address for scripts, encoded in **Bech32**.

* **P2TR** – Pay to Taproot
  Native SegWit v1 (Taproot) address, encoded using **Bech32m**.

> **Note:**
> Bech32 was introduced in [BIP-173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) for SegWit v0 (P2WPKH, P2WSH).
> Bech32m, defined in [BIP-350](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki), is used for SegWit v1 (P2TR).

#### Special Formats

In addition to standard script types, the importer also recognizes and supports several special address encodings:

* **Bitcoin Cash (Base58 prefix `q`)**  
  Legacy Bitcoin Cash addresses using the `q`-prefix are automatically converted to legacy Bitcoin format.

* **BitCore WKH**  
  Custom format prefixed with `wkh_` and encoded in **Base36**.

* **Riecoin P2SH as ScriptPubKey**  
  Riecoin P2SH addresses are provided as raw ScriptPubKey hex (starting with `76a914...`).

### Create the database by yourself
Useful txt/text file provider:
* http://blockdata.loyce.club/alladdresses/
* https://blockchair.com/dumps


### Export
The exporter provides various output formats for Bitcoin and altcoin address data:

* **HexHash**  
  Exports addresses as raw `hash160` (RIPEMD-160 of the SHA-256 of the public key), encoded in hexadecimal. No version byte or checksum is included. Ideal for advanced usage and low-level comparison. Best viewed in fixed-width hex viewers (e.g., HxD).

* **FixedWidthBase58BitcoinAddress**  
  Exports Base58Check-encoded addresses (e.g., legacy `P2PKH`) in a fixed-width format for consistent alignment. No amount is included. Suitable for hex/byte-aligned visual inspection and batch comparison.

* **DynamicWidthBase58BitcoinAddressWithAmount**  
  Exports Base58Check-encoded addresses along with their associated amounts (e.g., balance or UTXO value), using a dynamic-width format. Suitable for human-readable CSV-like formats and analytics.

### Use My Prepared Database
I am in the process of building and publishing databases containing large sets of Bitcoin and altcoin addresses.  
(Refer to the **Import** section above for details on supported address formats.)

> The sources of these addresses are confidential, but you are fully permitted to extract, inspect, and use them.

You are also welcome to **extend this database** by importing your own address data. This allows you to build upon the existing dataset, tailoring it to your specific needs (e.g., adding additional coins, formats, or private address collections).

If you're missing any information or have questions about usage or content, feel free to ask or open an issue.

#### Light database
* Light (5.4 GiB), Last update: July 1, 2025
  * Contains Bitcoin addresses whith amount and many altcoin addresses with amount.
  * Static amount of 0 is used to allow best compression.
  * Unique entries: 132288304
  * Mapsize: 5576 MiB
  * Time to create the database: ~9 hours
  * Link (3.66 GiB zip archive): http://ladenthin.net/lmdb_light.zip
  * Link extracted addresses as txt (5.17 GiB) (2.29 GiB zip archive); open with HxD, set 42 bytes each line: http://ladenthin.net/LMDBToAddressFile_Light_HexHash.zip

> 💡 **Hint:** When using the light database, it is **strongly recommended** to enable the following setting in your configuration:
> ```json
> "loadToMemoryCacheOnInit" : true
> ```  
> Although LMDB is very fast, a Java `HashSet` provides true **O(1)** lookups compared to **O(log n)** (or worse) with disk-backed access.
> Enabling this flag loads all addresses into memory at startup, resulting in significantly higher throughput during key scanning — especially for OpenCL or high-frequency batch operations.

## Pages and projects to get lists (dumps) of PubkeyHash addresses
* https://github.com/Pymmdrza/Rich-Address-Wallet
* https://github.com/mycroft/chainstate
* https://github.com/graymauser/btcposbal2csv
* https://blockchair.com/dumps
* https://balances.crypto-nerdz.org/

## Find Addresses
### 🔢 Key Generation Configuration  
BitcoinAddressFinder supports multiple pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) for private-key creation.
Pick one in your JSON via the `keyProducerJavaRandomInstance` field, e.g. `"keyProducerJavaRandomInstance": "SECURE_RANDOM"`.
This flexibility lets you switch between **production-grade entropy** and **deterministic or deliberately weak sources** for audits and research.

#### Key producer Use Cases
* 🔐 Secure wallet generation
* 🧪 Testing deterministic output
* 🕵️ Simulating vulnerabilities
* 🔄 Reproducible scans

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**: This software is intended for research and educational purposes. Do **not** use it in production or on systems connected to the internet.

A secure environment should be fully isolated — ideally an air-gapped computer (physically disconnected from all networks).  
The software is highly optimized for performance and **not designed to run in constant time**, which means it may be vulnerable to **side-channel attacks** on shared or exposed systems.

For generated vanity addresses or private keys, consider storing them safely using a [paper wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet).

#### Supported PRNG Modes (key producer java random)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `SECURE_RANDOM` | ✅ Cryptographically secure system CSPRNG (`/dev/urandom`, Windows CNG). **Recommended for real wallet generation.** |
| `RANDOM_CURRENT_TIME_MILLIS_SEED` | ⚠️ `java.util.Random` seeded with the current timestamp. **Insecure**; handy for replaying time-window RNG flaws. |
| `RANDOM_CUSTOM_SEED` | ⚠️ `java.util.Random` with user-supplied seed. Fully deterministic; useful for reproducible fuzzing or fixed keyspaces. |
| `SHA1_PRNG` | ⚠️ Legacy “SHA1PRNG” engine (Android pre-2013). Lets you reproduce the historic SecureRandom bug. |

#### Examples
##### 🔐 `SECURE_RANDOM`  
Best choice for real wallet generation – uses system CSPRNG (e.g. `/dev/urandom`, Windows CNG).
```json
...
"keyProducerJavaRandom": [
  {
    "keyProducerId": "exampleKeyProducerId",
    "keyProducerJavaRandomInstance": "SECURE_RANDOM"
  }
],
...
```

##### 🕰️ `RANDOM_CURRENT_TIME_MILLIS_SEED`  
Recreates time-based vulnerabilities using `java.util.Random` seeded with the current system time.
```json
...
"keyProducerJavaRandom": [
  {
    "keyProducerId": "exampleKeyProducerId",
    "keyProducerJavaRandomInstance": "RANDOM_CURRENT_TIME_MILLIS_SEED"
  }
],
...
```

##### 🧪 `RANDOM_CUSTOM_SEED`
Fully deterministic PRNG using `java.util.Random` with a user-defined seed. Useful for reproducible scans and testing.

Fully deterministic output. Useful for reproducible tests or fixed keyspace scans.
Without explicit seed:
```json
...
"keyProducerJavaRandom": [
  {
    "keyProducerId": "exampleKeyProducerId",
    "keyProducerJavaRandomInstance": "RANDOM_CUSTOM_SEED"
  }
],
...
```

With custom deterministic seed:
```json
...
"keyProducerJavaRandom": [
  {
    "keyProducerId": "exampleKeyProducerId",
    "keyProducerJavaRandomInstance": "RANDOM_CUSTOM_SEED",
    "customSeed": 123456789
  }
],
...

#### 🔢 incremental scanning (key producer java incremental)
This mode generates private keys **sequentially in batches** within a specified key range. It is especially useful for:

- **Systematic scanning** of a defined keyspace range (e.g., for key recovery or cryptographic research)
- **Batch processing** optimized for GPU/OpenCL parallelization
- Ensuring **deterministic and reproducible key generation** from start to end

#### Configuration Fields
| JSON field     | Type   | Default                                                                                    | Purpose                                                      |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `startAddress` | string | `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`                         | Hex string of the first private key in the range (inclusive) |
| `endAddress`   | string | `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141` (secp256k1 group order) | Hex string of the last private key in the range (inclusive)  |

#### How it works
- Scanning begins **at `startAddress`**, producing sequential private keys in batches of size `batchSize`, up to and including `endAddress`.
- Each batch contains exactly `batchSize` keys.
- If the next full batch would go **beyond `endAddress`**, the process stops with an **exception**.
- The **`endAddress` is inclusive**, but **partial batches are not allowed by default** — batches must fit completely inside the range.
- For optimal performance, especially with OpenCL, configure `batchSize` and your GPU's grid size so that batches align perfectly within the range. This prevents errors and maximizes throughput.

> **Note:** If unsure, set the `endAddress` slightly higher to closely match the batch size. This helps avoid exceptions and ensures efficient scanning.

---

#### Example JSON Configuration
Example minimal configuration:

```json
...
{
  "keyProducerJavaIncremental": [
    {
      "keyProducerId": "exampleKeyProducerId",
      "startAddress": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002",
      "endAddress": "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141"
    }
  ]
}
...
```

🧩 This configuration incrementally searches a defined range of private keys. It is particularly suited for brute-force challenges, such as the [71st Bitcoin puzzle transaction](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx?status=unsolved#p71).  
The private key range is specified by two 64-character hex strings: `startAddress` and `endAddress`.

```json
...
"keyProducerJavaIncremental": [
    {
      "keyProducerId": "exampleKeyProducerJavaIncremental",
      "startAddress": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000",
      "endAddress":   "00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007fffffffffffffffff"
    }
],

##### 🔄 Protocol
* Each private key must be exactly 32 raw bytes, sent binary, with no delimiter or framing.
* Keys are interpreted as big-endian (new BigInteger(1, bytes) in Java).
* Sending fewer than 32 bytes will cause blocking or exceptions.

#### 🌐 `SOCKET_STREAM` (key producer via ZeroMQ)
Receive raw private keys via a ZeroMQ `PULL` socket.
Ideal for decoupled key streaming where producers push keys using ZeroMQ `PUSH` sockets.

### Mixed Modes
You can combine **vanity address generation** with **database lookups** to enhance functionality and efficiency.

For example:
- Search for personalized (vanity) addresses using custom patterns **and**
- Simultaneously check if the generated addresses already **exist in the LMDB** database

This hybrid mode allows you to find rare or meaningful addresses while ensuring they haven’t been used before.

### Key Range

You can define a custom key range for private key generation—for example, limiting the search space to 64-bit keys.  
In this setup, the first 192 bits (256-bit - 64-bit) of the key are zeroed, effectively restricting the generation to a specific portion of the keyspace.

This feature can be used for:

- **Targeted key recovery**, such as searching for private keys from known ranges like the [Bitcoin Puzzle Transaction](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx)
- **Verification and testing**, to prove that the software functions correctly within a predictable key range

### OpenCL Acceleration

To significantly boost the performance of EC key generation, the software supports OpenCL-based parallelization.

A shared secret (base key) is transferred to the OpenCL device along with a predefined grid size. Each OpenCL thread independently derives a unique EC key by incrementing the base key with its thread ID. This allows the generation of a batch of EC keys in a single execution cycle. Once generated, the keys are transferred back to the host (CPU) memory for further processing.

The CPU then hashes the X and Y coordinates of the public keys to derive the corresponding (Bitcoin/Altcoin) addresses. This division of labor offloads the computationally expensive elliptic curve operations to the GPU, allowing the CPU to focus on faster address hashing and database lookup operations—resulting in improved overall throughput.

#### Built-in Self-Test (BIST)

The OpenCL backend includes a built-in self-test mechanism that cross-verifies results from the GPU against a CPU-generated reference. This ensures that the OpenCL device is functioning correctly and producing valid EC keys—giving end users confidence in the reliability of their hardware-accelerated address search.
> 💡 **Hint:** To enable the built-in self-test, make sure the following configuration flag is set to `true`:  
> ```json
> "runtimePublicKeyCalculationCheck": true
> ```  
> This option is disabled by default. Enabling it is especially useful during development, debugging, or when validating new hardware setups.

#### ⚠️ BIP-39 Deterministic Keys and Batch Mode Limitation

If you configure a **BIP-39 key producer** (e.g. `keyProducerJavaBip39`) together with OpenCL acceleration, please read this carefully.

The BIP-39 key producer creates **deterministic private keys** derived from your mnemonic, passphrase, and BIP32 path.  
This derivation space is **finite** — once all child keys along the defined path are exhausted, the producer will throw  
a `NoMoreSecretsAvailableException`. This can happen relatively quickly in GPU batch configurations.

In your JSON configuration, you may have enabled:

```java
/**
 * The batch mode will use a private key increment internal to increase the performance.
 */
public boolean batchUsePrivateKeyIncrement = true;
```

When `batchUsePrivateKeyIncrement` is set to `true`, the OpenCL producer calls:

```java
secrets = keyProducer.createSecrets(cProducer.getOverallWorkSize(bitHelper), cProducer.batchUsePrivateKeyIncrement);
```

Internally this sets `returnStartSecretOnly = true`, meaning that **only the first BIP-39-derived key** is passed to the GPU.  
The OpenCL kernel then uses that single key as a **base key**, incrementing the **least significant bits (LSB)** in parallel across all GPU threads to explore adjacent keyspaces.

> ⚠️ **Use extreme caution:**  
> - The effective search space on the GPU is *not* the same as the full BIP-39 derivation sequence.  
> - This mode is intended purely for experimental or high-performance batch testing — not for full HD-wallet traversal.  
> - Once all deterministic child keys are consumed, a `NoMoreSecretsAvailableException` will occur.

## Collision Probability and Security Considerations

> Isn't it impossible to find collisions?

The likelihood of discovering a collision—two different inputs that produce the same output hash—is **astronomically low** when using secure cryptographic functions like **SHA-256** and **RIPEMD-160**, which are employed in Bitcoin address generation.

However, discussions around potential vulnerabilities, theoretical attacks, or edge cases exist in the cryptography and Bitcoin communities.

### ⚠️ Security Advisory: Android RNG Vulnerability (2013) and Simulation via BitcoinAddressFinder
In 2013, a serious vulnerability was discovered in Android’s `SecureRandom` implementation. It caused Bitcoin private keys to be exposed due to reused or predictable random values during ECDSA signature creation. This problem affected many wallet apps that generated keys directly on Android devices.

BitcoinAddressFinder can be used to simulate and analyze this type of attack. With small changes, it can reproduce faulty random number generators by:
* using fixed or repeating `k` values
* limiting entropy to 16, 32, or 64 bits
* replacing the secure RNG with a weak or deterministic version

This makes it possible to test and study:
* how r-collisions happen in ECDSA signatures
* how easy it is to find reused `k` values
* how quickly a private key can be recovered
* how secure different RNG implementations really are

BitcoinAddressFinder can generate millions of key pairs quickly. This allows researchers to create and scan large keyspaces under controlled RNG conditions. All results can be verified using the built-in self-test feature or compared against known addresses in the LMDB database.

This kind of simulation is useful for:
* learning about signature security
* building training examples for audits or courses
* checking RNG quality in real wallets or custom apps

## Known Issues

### Hybrid Graphics Performance (Low Throughput)

Laptops with hybrid graphics—using both integrated (iGPU) and discrete (dGPU) GPUs—may suffer from significantly reduced performance when running compute-intensive OpenCL workloads like BitcoinAddressFinder. This is often due to:

- Shared memory between CPU and GPU
- Bandwidth limitations
- Automatic GPU switching (e.g., NVIDIA Optimus, AMD Enduro)
- Suboptimal GPU selection by drivers

#### Affected Devices and Recommendations

| Manufacturer       | Affected Series/Models                          | Recommendation                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **HP**             | ZBook G3, G4, G5, G7                             | Enter BIOS → set **Graphics** to *Discrete Only* |
| **Lenovo**         | ThinkPad X, T, and P Series (hybrid configs)     | Use **Lenovo Vantage** → Disable Hybrid Graphics |
| **Dell**           | Inspiron, XPS, Precision (with Optimus)          | BIOS → Disable Hybrid Mode (if available) |
| **MSI**            | Gaming laptops with switchable graphics          | Use **Dragon Center** to select dGPU     |
| **Razer**          | Blade models with NVIDIA Optimus                 | Use **Razer Synapse** to enforce dGPU use |
| **Apple (Intel)**  | MacBook Pro (pre-2021 with dual GPUs)            | macOS → Disable *Automatic Graphics Switching* in Energy Preferences |

> If your laptop uses hybrid graphics, always ensure that the **discrete GPU** is explicitly selected for OpenCL workloads to avoid severe performance bottlenecks.

## Future improvements
- Refactor the entire key generation infrastructure to support a key provider. This provider should be configurable to supply private keys from various sources, such as Random, Secrets File, Key Range, and others. All consumers should retrieve keys from this provider.

### KeyProvider
- Key generation within a specific key range. See #27

Wished from Ulugbek:
```
// Search started from given address. Would be nice if it can save last position...
"sequentalSearch" : true,
"startAddress" : xxxxxxxx,

// Random search with batches, here 100000. I,e. some random number is found and after 100000 sequental addresses should be checked.
"searchAsBatches" : true,
"searchBatchQuantity" : 100000,


// Random search within Address Space, with batches, here 100000.
"searchAsBatches" : true,
"searchAddressStart" : xxxxxxx,
"searchAddressEnd" : xxxxxxxy,
"searchBatchQuantity" : 100000
```

- Incomplete Seed-Phrase as Private KeyProvider. Wished from @mirasu See #38
- Socket KeyProvider for independend KeyProvider via byte protocol
  - Ideas might be a screen recorder and use the visible screen downscaled as 256 bit input
- KeyProvider must get the grid size to increment properly on incremental based Producer
- ExecutableKeyProvider gets data from stdout

- **§ 202c StGB** – *Vorbereiten des Ausspähens und Abfangens von Daten*  
  (Preparation of spying or intercepting data)
- **OLG Braunschweig, Beschluss vom 18.09.2024 – 1 Ws 185/24**  
  In einem aufsehenerregenden Fall entschied das OLG, dass der Zugriff auf eine Wallet mittels eines bekannten (nicht rechtswidrig erlangten) Seeds **nicht** als Straftat im Sinne der §§ 202a, 263a oder 303a StGB gewertet werden kann.  
  Der Angeklagte hatte eine Wallet für einen Dritten erstellt und sich später mittels der Seed-Phrase Zugriff auf Token im Wert von rund 2,5 Mio. € verschafft.  
  Das Gericht urteilte jedoch:

  - **Kein Diebstahl**: Kryptowährungen sind keine „Sachen“ im Sinne des § 242 StGB.  
  - **Kein Ausspähen von Daten (§ 202a StGB)**: Der Zugriff mittels bekannter Passwörter ist kein *Überwinden* einer Zugangssicherung.  
  - **Kein Computerbetrug (§ 263a StGB)**: Eine Krypto-Transaktion impliziert keine „Täuschung“ oder „Miterklärung einer Berechtigung“.  
  - **Keine Datenveränderung (§ 303a StGB)**: Die eigentliche Änderung erfolgt durch die Blockchain-Netzwerkbetreiber – nicht durch den User selbst.

  > 🔍 Fazit: Der *„Kryptodiebstahl“* per bekanntem Seed ist unter Umständen **nicht strafbar** – bleibt aber **zivilrechtlich angreifbar**.
