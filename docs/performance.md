# Performance & Tuning — BitcoinAddressFinder GPU Key Generation

This is the deep, technical reference for getting maximum throughput out of the secp256k1 OpenCL
key-generation kernel: how the kernel works, which parameters matter, how to choose them per device,
the full optimization history with measured results, and how to benchmark correctly.

For the high-level, user-facing overview of the same knobs (`batchSizeInBits`, `keysPerWorkItem`,
the address-lookup backends), see the **README**. This document is for choosing *optimal* settings
and understanding *why* — it goes well beyond the defaults.

---

## 1. TL;DR — how to go fast

1. **Use a discrete GPU via OpenCL** for key generation; the CPU consumer checks addresses in
   parallel.
2. **Raise `keysPerWorkItem`.** The default is `1`, which is the *slowest* setting (a full `k·G`
   scalar multiplication per key). The optimum is **device-dependent**; on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 Laptop
   it is `64`, which is ~8× faster than `1`. Sweep it on your hardware (§4).
3. **Match `batchSizeInBits` to the device** (e.g. `18` for a typical GPU, `20`–`21` for a high-end
   one) and ensure `batchSizeInBits` is divisible by `keysPerWorkItem`.
4. **Benchmark with `GridSizeSweepBenchmark`** and read §6 first — laptop GPUs throttle, and naive
   A/B comparisons are misleading.

The kernel implements the same two techniques the fastest open-source key searchers (BitCrack,
VanitySearch) use: a **fixed-base comb** for the one-time `k·G`, and an **affine batched-addition
walk** for the consecutive keys. The optimization history that got here is in §5.

---

## 2. How GPU key generation works

`__kernel generateKeysKernel_grid(...)` — `src/main/resources/inc_ecc_secp256k1custom.cl`.

A Find-mode batch covers `2^batchSizeInBits` consecutive private keys. The CPU aligns a candidate
down to a `2^batchSizeInBits` boundary (`secretBase`) and submits it once; the kernel launches
`2^batchSizeInBits / keysPerWorkItem` work-items. Each work-item produces `K = keysPerWorkItem`
consecutive keys for scalars `secretBase | (g·K + m)`, `m = 0 … K-1`. The combine is an **OR** (valid
because `secretBase`'s low bits are cleared).

Per work-item:

1. **Anchor `P₀ = k₀·G`** — one fixed-base **comb** scalar multiplication (§5, Stage 2). `G` is a
   fixed point, so `k·G` is read from a precomputed table with ~0 doublings.
2. **Walk (keys 1 … K-1)** — every key is `Pₘ = P₀ + m·G`, computed directly in **affine** from the
   same anchor `P₀` (§5, Stage 1). The fixed multiples `m·G` come from a host-uploaded `i·G` table,
   and a single **Montgomery simultaneous inversion** covers a whole `KEYS_BATCH_INV`-sized
   sub-batch.
3. **Per key** — two hash160 chains (SHA-256 → RIPEMD-160 of the uncompressed and the compressed SEC
   public key), then a 108-byte output entry. In compact mode a GPU Binary Fuse 8 filter decides
   which entries are emitted (claimed with `atomic_add`, OpenCL 2.0+).

**Field layer** (`src/main/resources/copyfromhashcat/inc_ecc_secp256k1.cl`): 8×`u32` limbs;
schoolbook `mul_mod` + fast reduction for `p = 2²⁵⁶ − 2³² − 977`; `add_mod`; `sub_mod`; `inv_mod` is
a binary extended-GCD (~256 data-dependent iterations) that guards `a == 0`.

### Why this is the hot path

Key generation dominates GPU runtime; address hashing + LMDB lookup run on the CPU consumer in
parallel. Within the kernel, **EC point arithmetic — not the SHA/RIPEMD hashing — is the
bottleneck**. Working backwards from the measured +37% gain when batched inversion was introduced
(removing 7 of every 8 `inv_mod`), EC arithmetic is ≈ 60–75% of kernel runtime, hashing ≈ 30%,
inversion now ≈ 4% (already batched).

---

## 3. The parameters that matter

### `keysPerWorkItem` (the big lever)

How many consecutive keys each work-item generates. `1` ⇒ one full `k·G` per key (slow). Higher ⇒
the expensive anchor `P₀ = k₀·G` is amortized over `K-1` cheap affine-addition steps, until too few
work-items remain to keep the GPU's compute units busy — so there is a **per-device sweet spot**.

- Must be a power of two; `batchSizeInBits` must be divisible by it.
- Default `1` is **not** optimal for scanning.
- On an RTX 3070 Laptop the optimum is `64` (§4 table). Weaker/older GPUs peak lower; sweep to find
  it.
- Config field: `producerOpenCL.keysPerWorkItem` (`CProducerOpenCL.java`).

### `batchSizeInBits`

Log₂ of the per-launch work size; each launch produces `2^batchSizeInBits` candidate keys.

| `batchSizeInBits` | Keys per batch | Use case |
|---|---:|---|
| `0` | 1 | sequential / secrets-file mode (no batching) |
| `14` | 16,384 | per-CPU-producer batch |
| `18` | 262,144 | typical OpenCL device |
| `20`–`21` | 1M–2M | high-end OpenCL device |

Upper bound: `PublicKeyBytes.BIT_COUNT_FOR_MAX_CHUNKS_ARRAY` (so per-batch result arrays stay within
Java's 32-bit array-length limit). Larger batches improve GPU occupancy and amortize launch overhead,
but cost more VRAM for the result buffer and more host readback per launch.

### `KEYS_BATCH_INV` (compile-time)

Sub-batch size for Montgomery's simultaneous inversion in the affine walk: `KEYS_BATCH_INV` points
share **one** `inv_mod` (plus a few multiplies per point) instead of one inverse each. It is a
`#define` in `inc_ecc_secp256k1custom.cl` (default `8`). Larger values amortize the inverse over more
keys but use more private scratch (lowering occupancy). It is **not** a runtime argument — it sizes
fixed-length private arrays, so changing it means editing the kernel (or prepending a `#define` to
the program source before `clBuildProgram`) and re-running. Re-sweep `keysPerWorkItem` after changing
it.

### Address-lookup backend (`addressLookupBackend`) and the GPU filter

Independent of the EC knobs above but performance-relevant: the `LMDB_ONLY` default keeps LMDB open
and exact; the in-RAM filters (`BLOOM`, `HASHSET`, `TRUNCATED_LONG_64`, `BINARY_FUSE_8/16`) trade RAM
for lookup speed; `producerOpenCL.enableGpuFilter` runs a Binary Fuse 8 pre-filter on the GPU so only
candidate hits are transferred over PCIe. See the README for the user-facing comparison; the GPU
filter's measured transfer saving (~1.28× at grid 19 on an RTX 3070) is benchmarked by
`GpuFuse8FilterBenchmark`.

---

## 4. Benchmarked tuning — `keysPerWorkItem` sweep

NVIDIA RTX 3070 Laptop GPU, OpenCL 3.0 CUDA, `batchSizeInBits = 20`, current kernel
(Stage 2). Candidates/s = JMH ops/s × `2^batchSizeInBits`.

| `keysPerWorkItem` | Throughput (~) | vs. `keysPerWorkItem = 1` |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 (default) | ~4 M keys/s | 1.0× |
| 8 | ~15 M keys/s | ~3.8× |
| 16 | ~17 M keys/s | ~4.3× |
| 32 | ~18 M keys/s | ~4.6× |
| **64** | **~19–20 M keys/s** | **~5× (peak)** |

Notes:

- The default `keysPerWorkItem = 1` pays a full scalar multiplication per key and is far from
  optimal.
- The sweet spot is **device-dependent** — set by the balance between amortizing the anchor `k·G`
  and keeping enough work-items to saturate the GPU. Sweep on your own hardware.
- Beyond the sweet spot, throughput drops because too few work-items remain to fill all compute units
  (e.g. `2^20 / 256 = 4096` work-items under-fills a 40-SM GPU at `keysPerWorkItem = 256`).
- After Stage 2 (cheap comb `P₀`) the curve is much **flatter** than it used to be: near-peak speed
  is reached at far lower `keysPerWorkItem` than before, so even a moderate value (8–16) is a big win
  on a wide range of GPUs.

Use `{"command":"OpenCLInfo"}` to confirm a device is present and pick `platformIndex` /
`deviceIndex` before benchmarking.

## 5. Optimization history (measured)

The kernel was optimized in stages; each stage is independently shippable, gated **byte-for-byte**
against the bitcoinj reference *before* any throughput claim (§7), and benchmarked with the
thermal-aware methodology in §6. All throughput in `M keys/s` (= JMH ops/s × `2^20 / 1e6`) on the
RTX 3070 Laptop, `GridSizeSweepBenchmark`, `batchSizeInBits = 20`.

### Reference baseline (original wNAF + Jacobian kernel)

| `keysPerWorkItem` | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| M keys/s | 2.51 | 4.51 | 6.82 | 10.92 | 14.17 | 16.00 | **18.54** |

The pre-optimization design computed `P₀` with a **wNAF** (window-4, `±1,3,5,7·G` table,
~256 doublings ≈ 2600 field-muls) and walked consecutive keys with a **Jacobian** mixed addition
(~11 `mul_mod` each) plus batched Montgomery inversion to convert back to affine. The wNAF `P₀`
dominated EC cost once the walk amortized it.

### Stage 0 — kernel build flags + `#pragma unroll` (no measurable gain; kept as hygiene)

`clBuildProgram` passes `-cl-std=CL2.0 -cl-mad-enable` (constant `CL_BUILD_OPTIONS` in
`OpenCLContext.java`), and `#pragma unroll` was added to the fixed 8-limb `mul_mod` / fast-reduction
loops in `copyfromhashcat/inc_ecc_secp256k1.cl`.

Parity: ✅ 5/5 byte-identical. Throughput: **no reliable gain** — every arm's JMH error bar overlaps
the baseline (e.g. kpwi=64: 18.4 ± 1.4 vs 17.7 ± 1.8 ops/s). Expected for an integer-only kernel:
`-cl-mad-enable` affects only floating-point math, the NVIDIA PTX compiler already unrolls these
small fixed-trip loops, and `-cl-std=CL2.0` only pins the OpenCL-2.0 semantics compact mode's
`atomic_add` already required. Kept because harmless, verified byte-identical, and it makes the
2.0 requirement explicit — but it is setup/hygiene, not a speed-up.

### Stage 1 — single-anchor affine batched-addition walk (+~10% at the sweet spot)

Replaces the per-key **Jacobian** walk with a **single-anchor affine** walk. Every key is
`Pₘ = P₀ + m·G`, computed directly in affine from the *same* anchor `P₀`, reading the fixed `m·G`
from a host-uploaded `i·G` table (`iG_table`, built once in `OpenCLContext.init()`). Anchoring all
points at one `P₀` makes the slope denominators `dx_m = x_{mG} − x₀` mutually independent, so a single
Montgomery simultaneous inversion still covers a sub-batch — but each key now costs ~6 `mul_mod` +
~6 `sub_mod` (the affine slope formula) instead of an ~11-multiply Jacobian add plus a per-point
`X/Z²,Y/Z³` conversion. No Jacobian state, less private scratch.

Correctness: ✅ byte-identical — `ProbeAddressesOpenCLTest` 5/5, full `@OpenCLTest` gate 77/0-fail,
plus a pure-Java `OpenCLContextIGTableTest` that pins the `i·G` table byte layout without a GPU.

Fair back-to-back A/B (baseline vs Stage 1), M keys/s:

| `keysPerWorkItem` | 1 | 4 | 16 | 32 | **64 (sweet spot)** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Baseline | 2.47 | 7.54 | 13.41 | 16.74 | 18.07 |
| Stage 1 | 1.96 | 6.16 | 13.32 | 16.08 | **19.83** |
| Δ | −21% | −18% | ~0% | ~−4% | **+9.8%** |

The walk rewrite only pays off where walk steps dominate the work-item: at kpwi=64, 63 of every 64
keys are cheap affine steps, so Stage 1 is **+9.8%** (error bars non-overlapping). At low
`keysPerWorkItem` there is little walk to speed up and the fixed per-sub-batch `inv_mod` + anchor
(`m=0`) overhead makes it slower — but production scans at the sweet spot.

### Stage 2 — fixed-base comb for the `P₀` anchor (+~11% at the sweet spot, up to 2× at low `keysPerWorkItem`)

Replaces the **wNAF** scalar multiplication for `P₀ = k₀·G` with a **fixed-base comb**. The scalar is
split into 64 four-bit windows, `k·G = Σ_pos comb_table[pos][digit_pos(k)]` (~64 mixed point-adds,
~0 doublings, vs the wNAF's ~256 doublings ≈ 2600 field-muls → ~700). The table
(`64 positions × 16 digits = 1024 affine points ≈ 64 KB`) is built once in `OpenCLContext.init()`
from the same bitcoinj curve the CPU reference uses (scalars reduced mod the group order `n`),
uploaded as a read-only buffer, and consumed by `point_mul_xy_comb` in the kernel. The Stage 1
affine walk is unchanged.

Correctness: ✅ byte-identical — full `@OpenCLTest` gate 86/0-fail plus a pure-Java
`OpenCLContextCombTableTest` that checks every table entry **and** reconstructs `k·G` by summing the
window points for 32 random scalars (validating the comb decomposition without a GPU).

Stage 1 → Stage 2, M keys/s (¹ = matched high-precision pair, 6 samples, same thermal window, error
bars disjoint at kpwi=64; other columns are the fair 3-sample sweep):

| `keysPerWorkItem` | 1 | 8 | 16 | 32 | **64 (sweet spot)** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Stage 1 | 1.89 | 9.26 | 12.63¹ | 16.34¹ | 17.37¹ |
| Stage 2 | 4.01 | 15.23 | 16.70¹ | 18.06¹ | **19.25¹** |
| Δ | **+112%** | **+64%** | +32% | +10.5% | **+10.8%** |

The comb's win is largest where `P₀` is **not** amortized: at kpwi=1 (a fresh `k·G` per key) it is
~**2×**, +64% at kpwi=8. At the kpwi=64 sweet spot `P₀` is only 1/64 of the work — already cheap
after Stage 1 — so the remaining ceiling is the affine walk + the two hash160 chains, and the comb
still adds a clean **+10.8%**. The optimum stays at the high end (≥64) but the curve is far flatter.

### Cumulative result

Stage 1 (+9.8%) × Stage 2 (+10.8%) ≈ **~+21% at the sweet spot** over the original wNAF + Jacobian
kernel, and a **multiple** of that at low `keysPerWorkItem`. This is the BitCrack/VanitySearch design:
fixed-base table for `k·G` + affine batched-addition walk.

## 6. Benchmarking methodology (read before trusting any number)

### Thermal throttling is the #1 source of bogus comparisons

Laptop (and some desktop) GPUs throttle under sustained load. On the RTX 3070 Laptop the **same**
kernel measured **16.8 ops/s hot vs 18.9 ops/s cool** at kpwi=64 — an ~11–15% swing that **swamps**
the per-stage deltas being measured. Tight within-run JMH error bars do **not** capture this
between-run drift.

**Only a matched comparison is trustworthy:** measure baseline and candidate **back-to-back in the
same thermal window** (ideally consecutive runs, both with warmup), and compare the *relative* delta.
Absolute numbers from different sessions are not comparable. Large effects (the >50%
low-`keysPerWorkItem` gains) survive thermal noise; small ones (the ~10% operating-point gains) need
the matched-pair discipline and enough samples for disjoint error bars.

### JMH harness

`GridSizeSweepBenchmark` (`src/test/java/.../benchmark/`) drives `OpenCLContext.createKeys(...)`
inside the timed region. Kernel compilation (the one-time cost) runs in `@Setup`, outside timing.
For GPU benchmarks prefer **one long measurement iteration** over many short samples to reach steady
clocks; the staged A/Bs above used `-f 1 -wi 1 -w 20 -i 3 -r 20` (sweeps) and `-i 6` (high-precision
operating-point confirms).

### Running it locally

The README documents `mvn test-compile exec:java -Dexec.args="GridSizeSweepBenchmark …"`. **On
Windows that exec form was observed to fail** — the JMH JVM forks cannot find
`org.openjdk.jmh.runner.ForkedMain` (the `exec-maven-plugin` runs JMH in-process and the fork does
not inherit its classpath). The reliable recipe is to launch JMH directly so the fork inherits a real
`-cp`:

```bash
# 1. materialise the full test-scope classpath (includes jmh-core)
mvn -q dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=target/cp-test.txt -DincludeScope=test

# 2. run JMH directly; the --add-opens set must match pom.xml <argLine> (lmdbjava reflects into
#    sun.nio.ch). Use ';' as the classpath separator on Windows, ':' on POSIX.
java --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED \
     --add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED \
     --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED \
     --add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED \
     --add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED \
     --add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED \
     -cp "target/test-classes;target/classes;$(cat target/cp-test.txt)" \
     org.openjdk.jmh.Main GridSizeSweepBenchmark \
     -p batchSizeInBits=20 -p keysPerWorkItem=1,2,4,8,16,32,64 -f 1 -wi 1 -w 20 -i 3 -r 20
```

Other benchmarks: `GpuFuse8FilterBenchmark` (filter/transfer path, `keysPerWorkItem = 1`; enable
`-p profiling=true` to split device kernel vs readback nanos). GPU benchmarks self-skip when no
OpenCL 2.0+ device is present.

---

## 7. Correctness gating

Every kernel change is gated **before** any throughput is reported. These run under pocl (CI's
`test-opencl` job) or a real GPU; `@OpenCLTest` classes self-skip when no device is present.

```bash
mvn test -Dtest='ProbeAddressesOpenCLTest,OpenCLCompactOutputIntegrationTest,OpenCLContextTest,Fuse8GpuHashParityTest,ProducerOpenCLTest,OpenCLContextIGTableTest,OpenCLContextCombTableTest'
```

- **`ProbeAddressesOpenCLTest#createKeys_acrossKeysPerWorkItem_allResultsMatchReference`** — the
  primary gate. Byte-compares GPU X/Y **and** both hash160s against `ECKey.fromPrivate(secretBase | i,
  …)` for every work-item, across `keysPerWorkItem ∈ {1,2,4,8,16}`.
- **`OpenCLCompactOutputIntegrationTest`** — compact-mode hit-set vs a CPU oracle (filter + emit +
  buffer plumbing).
- **`OpenCLContextTest`** — init/upload/close lifecycle; the device buffers must allocate in `init()`
  and release in `close()` without leaking.
- **`OpenCLContextIGTableTest` / `OpenCLContextCombTableTest`** — pure-Java table generators
  (no GPU): every `i·G` and comb entry decodes back to the bitcoinj point, and the comb sum
  reconstructs `k·G`.
- **`Fuse8GpuHashParityTest`** — the pure-Java filter-hash contract the kernel filter must match.

**Never report a speedup from a build whose parity tests have not passed.** This is the cryptographic
hot path; correctness is paramount.

---

## 8. Future work / not-yet-done levers

Evaluated during the investigation; candidates for a future stage (re-sweep `keysPerWorkItem` after
any of these, since the per-key cost balance shifts):

- **Fermat inversion** (`a^(p−2)` via an addition chain) instead of binary-GCD: warp-uniform (no
  data-dependent iteration count) vs GCD's divergence. But inversion is only ~4% of runtime
  post-batching ⇒ headroom ≤ ~4%. A cheap A/B, not a headline.
- **Larger / re-tuned comb window** (e.g. 5-bit windows) or moving the comb table to `__constant`
  memory (64 KB fits, but competes with `g_precomputed`). The current `T[pos][digit]` read is
  secret-keyed (data-dependent, not a warp broadcast) — cache-resident and occupancy-hidden, but
  benchmark alternatives per device.
- **Optional single-hash (compressed-only) mode:** skip one of the two hash160 chains (~+15% if
  hashing ~30% of runtime) — but it is a coverage/semantics change (would miss uncompressed P2PKH
  hits), so it must be opt-in and clearly documented.
- **±P symmetry** (one addition yields `P` and `−P`): random-search mode only — for sequential range
  scanning the `−P` keys fall outside the scanned range.
- **Rejected:** GLV endomorphism (subsumed by the fixed-base comb, which already removes almost all
  doublings); Karatsuba / Montgomery field form (schoolbook + special-prime reduction is already
  near-optimal at this width on GPU); moving hashing to the CPU (defeats the compact-output Binary
  Fuse 8 design).
